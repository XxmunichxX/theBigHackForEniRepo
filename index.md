*Hello everyone, we are team4. We decided to partecipate to this challenge
proposed by Eni because
all of us we truly believe that we need to do something to build a better world for
our future.
We think we can start from our daily behaviours and needs.*

Transportation's problem is something that we have to face in our every-day life
and actually is the aspect that influences the most our environment.
With our vision we want to point to the fact that everyone of us is responsible for
our environment and everyone of us can play his role to build a better
neighbrohood, a better city, a better world.
Our journey starts with two simple questions: which is your impact? How do you
want to manage it? With our concept we want to make the user conscious of his
impact on the environment he's living in and we want to give him a quick, intuitive,
sustainable solution.

Indeed, simple questions. We are going to measure the effective impact of the user
with these two simple questions. Plus, if the user is, at the same time, already
registered on the Eni Plenitude platform, we are gonna merge the data to have a
complete and precise vision of his/her real impact.

Once we have this data, we are going to share with the user our solution to make
his/her impact get lower and lower.
(MOSTRARE LA NUVOLA)
Based on the result of the impact, a dark evil cloud is gonna come alive upon the
head of our user avatar(?!), but no worries! We are now going to give you the
solution to let it go away.
The App is gonna suggest personalized actions, specifically builded around the
needs of the user, to let the dark cloud go away like ranting some electric vehicles,
like cars or scooters. With the integration of Eni Enjoy, we can show the user in real
time where he can find the closest one.

The more the user will get his impact lower, the more he/she'll gain points.

Every reached level will give to the user the chance to claim different rewards, like a
discount on the next electric bill or a discount on the next electric car.

But there's more. We thought about some areas around our cities
to revitalize.

We thought about special places where to build Eni hubs where
users could get the chance to get something more. We decided
to call this places: Eni Oasi.

So, what's Oasi? Oasi is the most tangible way to get our users involved about the
sustainability of their environment.

We thought about Oasi like our ideal environment in the middle of the huge noise
of our city. Once in an Oasi, the user will be able to recharge his/her vehicle, sitting
on a bench in the middle of the green while he/she's gaining points over point
while recharging, but again.. there's more.
We wanted the user, the citizen, to have a concrete impact on his/her city. That's
why we thought about the chance to let the user customize his/her Oasi. How?
Planting his/her own plants! Once recharging has finished and the user it's about to
pay the app will ask him/her if he/she desire to buy a plant, a specific one from a list,
that Eni itself is gonna plant at that specific Oasi.

If the user is gonna buy a plant, his/her impact will automatically reduce, his/her
score is gonna grow, more advantages and offers he/she's gonna have.

Et voil√†! The dark cloud is defeated! 

Finally, whit this integrated app, our goal is to give to the user everything he/she
needs to make his/her city a better city to live in. Even more, we want to simplify
and to merge all the processes around the Eni world to make the user feel more
comfortable with all the services the company holds giving a unique place and
solution to take advantage of for their transportation needs.
Thank you for your attention
